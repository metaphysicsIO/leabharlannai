# leabharlannaè´ø

### What is a leabharlannaè´ø?

It means librarian in Irish.

### What is this?

This is just a linked list example in C++.

I also use it for managing my personal library. It is currently cli only,
but maybe I will make some OpenGL window. It could be a good extension.

I plan to add a feature for it digital libraries, as well.
I will start with pdfs/mobi/etc. but I like the idea of using
it for audio and videos as well. 

### Why TSV instead of CSV?

I use tab-separated values instead of comma-separated values
because some books contain commas but I don't know of a book
that contains a tab.

### Why not some other system?

I want the file to be able to be uploaded to some type of sheets
(Google, libreoffice, MS Office, etc.)

Plus this is easier. 

### What about expanding x, y, z

Put in an issue.
